       Title: Professional golfer<br>
       <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Jordan Alexander Spieth is an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour and former world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking.<br>
       He is a three-time major winner and the 2015 FedEx Cup champion. In April 2016, Time magazine named Spieth to its list of the &quot;100 Most Influential People&quot;,<br>
       noting that he &quot;exemplifies everything that&apos;s great about sports.&quot; Spieth&apos;s first major win came in the 2015 Masters Tournament,<br>
       when he shot a 270 (âˆ’18) and pocketed $1.8 million. He tied the 72-hole record set by Tiger Woods in 1997 and became the second youngest golfer (behind Woods)<br>
       to win the Masters. He then won the 2015 U.S. Open with a score of 5-under-par. He was the youngest U.S. Open champion since amateur Bobby Jones in 1923.<br>
       He followed up with a win in the 2015 Tour Championship, which clinched the 2015 FedEx Cup. Two years later, Spieth won his third major at the <br>
       2017 Open Championship, by three shots at 12 under-par.<br>
       <p>In 2010, Jordan Spieth signed a 10 year extension with Under Armour. The deal guarantees that Spieth, 21, will wear only Under Armour head to toe,<br>
           including golf shoes, which will hit retail later this year.<br>
    &quot;I really enjoyed being on this journey with Under Armour since turning professional and I can&apos;t wait to accomplish great things together in this <br>
    next phase of my career,&quot; Spieth said in a statement.<br></p>
