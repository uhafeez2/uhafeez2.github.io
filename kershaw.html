        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> 
        
        Clayton Edward Kershaw is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB).<br>
        A left-handed starting pitcher, Kershaw has played in the major leagues since 2008, and his career earned run average (ERA) and walks and hits per innings<br>
        pitched average (WHIP) are the lowest among starters in the live-ball era with a minimum of 1,000 innings pitched. Kershaw has a career hits allowed<br>
        per nine innings pitched average of 6.61â€”the second-lowest in MLB history, along with three Cy Young Awards and the 2014 National League Most Valuable Player Award.<br>
        He has been described as the best pitcher in baseball. Kershaw was drafted seventh overall in the 2006 MLB draft. <br>
        He worked his way through the Dodgers&apos; farm system in just one full season, and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he debuted in 2008, he was<br>
        the youngest player in MLB, a title he held for one full year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award,<br>
        becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, <br>
        becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared<br>
        to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. He became the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive years when he did so<br>
        in the 2011 through 2014 seasons.<br>
        <p>The three-time Cy Young Award-winner has been with Under Armour since breaking into Major League Baseball in 2008. <br>
        In 2015, Under Armour Inc. signed Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw to a multiyear extension</p>
