        Team: New England Patriots<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. is an American football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). <br>
        Brady one of only two players to win five Super Bowls. After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots<br>
        in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. In Brady's 15 seasons as a starter, he has quarterbacked the Patriots to seven Super Bowl appearances,<br>
        the most for any player in history. Brady has been honored with four Super Bowl MVP awards (Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, and LI), the most ever by<br>
        a single player, has won two league MVP awards (2007 and 2010), has been selected to 13 Pro Bowls, and has led his team to more division titles (15) than any<br>
        other quarterback in NFL history. As of the end of the 2016 season, Brady is fourth all-time in career passing yards, fourth in career touchdown passes,<br>
        and third in career passer rating. His career postseason record is 25&mdash;9, winning more playoff games than any other quarterback, and he has appeared in more <br>
        playoff games than any player at any position. Brady has never had a losing season as a starting quarterback in the NFL. His combined regular-season and postseason<br>
        wins are also the most of any quarterback in NFL history. Because of his accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among <br>
        the greatest quarterbacks of all time. Due to his late draft selection, Brady is considered to be the biggest &quot;steal&quot; in the history of the NFL Draft.<br>
        <p> In 2010, Brady left Nike and signed with Under Armour. &quot;Under Armour's everything I was looking for,&quot; Brady said. &quot;It's cool. It's fun. It's what<br>
        so many of the kids are wearing, and I like to try to stay cutting-edge. I like the company. I think we've got a lot in common. We both want to stay hungry,<br>
        stay humble.&quot;
