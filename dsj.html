        Team: Dallas Mavericks<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Dennis Smith Jr. plays for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and attended NC State University<br>
        for one season of college basketball. After the season, Smith decided to forgo his remaining college eligibility and declared for the 2017 NBA draft,<br>
        where he was selected 9th overall by the Mavericks. <br>
        <p>
        After his impressive Summer League in Vegas, Smith Jr. cashed in when he signed a three-year deal with Under Armour worth around $2 million <br>
        a year in incentives per ESPN. A deal that many can&apos;t imagine signing as a 19-year-old kid, but a decision that he said was an easy one based on the people<br>
        he had around him sifting through that process.<q> Whenever you make that decision, it has to be a business decision. That could be difficult for somebody, <br>
            but for me I had my father and we have a pretty good team. It was a lot going into that decision, but business wise it was kind of easy to make and I think<br>
            I made the best choice for me</q>, Smith Jr. said when I asked him about the process of choosing a shoe company as a 19-year-old.<br>
            <q>I am definitely excited to be a part of team Under Armour as I get ready to go into [training] camp for my rookie year,</q> Smith Jr. said to ESPN. <br>
            <q>Under Armour is an explosive brand in basketball right now, and I am excited to join Stephen Curry and the team at UA in making our mark together.</q><br>
