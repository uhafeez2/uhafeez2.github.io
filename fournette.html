        Team: Jacksonville Jaguars<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br>Leonard Joseph Fournette III is an American football running back for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL).<br>
        He played college football at LSU, and was drafted by the Jaguars with the fourth overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. Fournette was a consensus All-America<br>
        selection following his sophomore season in 2015, after setting school single-season records with 1,953 rushing yards and 22 rushing touchdowns, and leading<br>
        the country with 162.8 rushing yards per game. Various experts regarded him as the best player in college football, comparing him to all-time great Herschel Walker.<br>
Fournette joined the Tigers with near-unprecedented hype in 2014 after an outstanding career at St. Augustine High School in New Orleans, winning the 2013 <br>
        USA Today High School Football Offensive Player of the Year and being named the No. 1 overall recruit in 2014 senior class according to ESPN, 247Sports.com, <br>
        and CBS Sports.
        <p>In January 2017, Fournette signed a multi-year deal with Under Armour that a source said is one of the most valuable endorsement contracts ever for an NFL rookie.<br>
            &quot;We have a roster of athletes that we choose and we&apos;re never going to be that company that just collects athletes just to have the most,&quot;<br>
            said Ryan Kuehl, the company&apos;s senior vice president of sports marketing. &quot;We look for special people, who have the talent, the character, the story<br>
            and the sense of purpose. Leonard Fournette fits that model.&quot;<br>
            Fournette wore Under Armour in high school at St. Augustine in New Orleans and played in the Under Armour All-America game in 2014, where he announced his decision<br>
            to go to LSU. &quot;I&apos;ve always had a great relationship with Under Armour and it means a lot that a company wants me to wear their product and that I&apos;m <br>
            good enough to represent them,&quot; said Fournette.
