        As an avid sports fan and someone who regularly participates in team sports (mainly basketball), over the years, I have developed an enthusiasm towards<br>
        brands who are at the pinnacle of today&apos;s activewear and performance based products. One brand in particular that I have supported for many years<br>
        and is taking the sports and fitness world by storm is Under Armour. Not only has Under Armour continued to raise the bar with every single product launch<br>
        since its founding in 1996, but it has also done a magnificent and praiseworthy job in scouting the next wave of elite sports talent, and offering them sponsorship deals.<br>
        Personally, I highly enjoy watching Under Armour athletes such as Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, as well as newly signed rookie sensation Dennis Smith Jr.<br>
        I am also a very big fan of the Under Armour Association (UAA), which is Under Armour&apos;s basketball AAU circuit, tailored towards the top high school players. <br>
        Some of my favorite NBA players who played for the UAA in the past include Milwaukee Bucks player Thon Maker, and Phoenix Suns Forward Josh Jackson, <br>
        who was selected as the fourth pick of the 2017 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns. <br>
    </P>
    <p>
        With all that being said, I wanted to develop a website that displays the great diversity of Under Armour athletes and showcases the talent that separates<br>
        UA from other competitor brands. This site serves as a database containing an ever-growing list of astounding athletes that are a part of the Under Armour family.<br>
        In the &quot;Home&quot; page, you will find a list of Under Armour athletes on which you can click on any of the names to learn more about that particular athlete. <br>
        Furthermore, in the &quot;Gallery&quot; page, you will find some of my personal favorite pictures of some UA athletes and products.
        Enjoy!
