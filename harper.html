        Team: Washington Nationals<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Bryce Aron Max Harper is an American professional baseball right fielder for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB).<br>
        He stands 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighs 230 pounds (100 kg). Harper was chosen by the Nationals with the first overall pick in the<br>
        2010 Major League Baseball Draft. Harper won the 2010 Golden Spikes Award, awarded annually to the best amateur baseball player. Going into the 2012 season,<br>
        baseball prospect-watchers, including Baseball America, MLB.com, and Baseball Prospectus routinely ranked Harper as a top-3 prospect. <br>
        He made his MLB debut with the Nationals on April 28, 2012. Harper was selected for the 2012 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest position player to<br>
        ever be selected. Harper won the NL Rookie of the Year Award in 2012. He tied for the NL lead in home runs in the 2015 Major League Baseball season, <br>
        and was named the National League Most Valuable Player for 2015 by unanimous decision of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.<br>
        <p>In 2016, Harper signed the richest endorsement deal ever given to a baseball player, which was a 10-year extension with Under Armour,<br>
            which signed its first deal with Harper in April 2011 (when he was only 18 and still in the minor leagues). </p>
