       Title: Professional golfer<br>
       <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Bernd Wiesberger is an Austrian professional golfer who plays on the European Tour. He finished the 2015 and 2016 seasons in ninth place <br>
       on the Race to Dubai standings, his career best finish to date. In July 2015, when he won the Alstom Open de France, Wiesberger became the most successful <br>
       Austrian golfer on the European Tour with three tour victories. He has since extended his record and is a four-time winner on the European Tour.<br>
       Wiesberger claimed his fourth European Tour victory at the 2017 Shenzhen International. He won with a birdie at the first extra hole, in a sudden-death playoff, <br>
       to defeat Tommy Fleetwood. Fleetwood had earlier shot a final round of 63 to come from eight strokes back and set the clubhouse lead. Wiesberger had to scramble <br>
       for pars on the back nine and then almost holed his approach shot on the 72nd hole for the victory. In the playoff, Wiesberger found trouble from the tee, but hit<br>
       his approach to within five feet for birdie to claim victory. His fourth victory came in his 200th event on the European Tour.<br>
