        Team: Jacksonville Jaguars<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Myles David Jack is an American football linebacker for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL).<br>
        He played college football for the UCLA Bruins. In his first season, he was named the top freshman college football player in the Pac-12, receiving honors<br>
        both on defense as well as on offense for his work as a running back. As a sophomore in 2014, he was named an All-Pac-12 linebacker for the second straight season.<br>
        His season ended prematurely in 2015, when he suffered a season-ending knee injury. Jack was selected by Jacksonville in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft.<br>
        <p>In 2016, Myles Jack became the first prospect in this year&apos;s NFL Draft class to clinch a major apparel and footwear deal, signing with Under Armour.<br>
            Under Armour said it singled out Jack as &quot;one of the most dynamic and exciting talents in this year&apos;s NFL Draft class.&quot;<br>
            &quot;Myles demonstrated that he is not only one of the most electric defensive players in college football, but is one of the hardest workers, in training<br>
            and preparation,&quot; Ryan Kuehl, vice president for sports marketing and sponsorships, said in the announcement.<br>
