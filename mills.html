        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Patrick "Patty" Mills is an Australian professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA).<br>
        Mills was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the 55th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft after playing two years of college basketball for Saint Mary's. <br>
        Although born and raised in Canberra, he is a Torres Strait Islander, and in 2007, he became only the third indigenous basketballer to play for Australia behind <br>
        Olympians Michael Ah Matt (1964) and Danny Morseu (1980&mdash;84).<br>
        <p>
        In 2014, Mills signed on to be a part of Under Armours roster of world-class athletes.<br>
        <q>I joined Under Armour, they are an up and coming brand in basketball but they are established in baseball and football.<br>
            They've got a lot of new stuff coming through, Steph Curry and Brandon Jennings are on board as well and they are great players. <br>
            It is really exciting and that attracted me to the company. I was looking at their goals and what it means to be an Under Armour athletes,<br>
            once I realized what they were trying to do as a company I realized it fit with who I am as a person and where I am from.<br>
            The values I have matched the ones that Under Armour have.</q>
