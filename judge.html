        Team: NY Yankees<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Aaron James Judge is an American professional baseball outfielder for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB).<br>
        Judge played college baseball at Fresno State. A right-handed batter and thrower, Judge, who stands 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighs 282 pounds (128 kg), <br>
        is one of the physically largest players in the major leagues.<br>
        The Yankees selected Judge in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft. After making his MLB debut in 2016 and hitting a home run in his first career at bat,<br>
        Judge went on to have a record-breaking rookie season in 2017. He was named an All-Star and won the Home Run Derby, the first rookie to do so.<br>
        He broke the Yankees&apos; record for home runs by a rookie (besting Joe DiMaggio&apos;s 29 with 30 before the All-Star break). <br>
        He won the American League&apos;s (AL) Rookie of the Month Awards for April, May, June and September, as well as the AL&apos;s Player of the Month Award<br>
        for June and September. Judge hit 52 home runs as a rookie, breaking Mark McGwire's MLB rookie record of 49. He also hit 33 home runs at Yankee Stadium,<br>
        breaking the record of 32 set by Babe Ruth in 1921.<br>
        Judge was unanimously selected as the American League Rookie of the Year for 2017 and placed second, behind Jose Altuve, for AL Most Valuable Player.<br>
        <p>Under Armour signed Aaron Judge to an endorsement deal while the breakout New York Yankees star was still in the minor leagues, and UA says<br>
            that it is negotiating a long-term extension with him as it continues to deepen its partnership with baseball.</p>
