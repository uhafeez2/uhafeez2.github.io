       Title: Professional golfer<br>
       <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Gary Woodland is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour. In March 2011, Woodland won his first PGA Tour title<br>
       at the Transitions Championship by one stroke when fellow American Webb Simpson missed a par putt on the final hole. Just a few moments earlier Woodland had <br>
       scrambled a fantastic par from the same position as Simpson on the last, after hitting his second shot over the back of the green. This win secured Woodland<br>
       a place at the 2011 Masters Tournament and also elevated him to a career high 53rd in the Official World Golf Rankings. He later earned an invitation into the<br>
       U.S. Open after moving into the Top 50. He left the tournament with an OWGR ranking of 39th. In November 2011, he won the Omega Mission Hills World Cup with<br>
       Matt Kuchar. He finished 2011 ranked 17th on the PGA Tour money list and 51st in the OWGR. He had ended 2009 ranked 959th and 2010 588th. Woodland reached the<br>
       final of the 2015 WGC-Cadillac Match Play, where he lost to Rory McIlroy, and moved to a career-best 32nd in the OWGR.<br>
