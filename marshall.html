        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Brandon Tyrone Marshall is an American football wide receiver for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL).<br>
        He played college football at UCF, and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Marshall has also played for the Miami Dolphins,<br>
        Chicago Bears and New York Jets. Marshall is known for his ability to break and dodge tackles. He led all NFL wide receivers in yards after first contact<br>
        for the 2007 NFL season. Regarding Marshall&apos;s breakaway ability, cornerback Brandon Flowers said, &quot;Brandon Marshall is a defensive lineman playing wide<br>
        receiver. He wants to inflict punishment on you. He wants you to try to tackle him so he can shove you off of him and get more yards.&quot;<br>
        Cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha said Marshall is &apos;the toughest guy to bring down, one-on-one.&apos;<br>
        <p>In 2014, Marshall signed with Under Armour.</p>
