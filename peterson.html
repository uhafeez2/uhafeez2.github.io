        Team: Arizona Cardinals<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Patrick De'mon Peterson is an American football cornerback for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL).<br>
        He played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU), where he won the Chuck Bednarik Award as the best defensive player in the country,<br>
        the Jim Thorpe Award as the best defensive back, and was unanimously recognized as an All-American. He was selected fifth overall by the Cardinals in the<br>
        first round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Peterson has been invited to the Pro Bowl in each of his first seven seasons in the NFL, and is considered to be one of the<br>
        best cornerbacks in the league. <br>
        <p>In 2015, Peterson left Nike and signed a deal with Under Armour to began endorsing the brand. &quot;At Nike I just felt like another guy and<br>
            didn't have an opportunity to build a brand and get into the football community as far as the kids and high schools,&quot; said Peterson in an interview<br>
            with FORBES.  &quot;Under Armour is giving me the ability to build a brand and help this company grow. It has so much upside. Cam Newton, Tom Brady, Ed Reed.<br>
            Seeing the progression it is making each and every year is unbelievable.&quot;</p>
