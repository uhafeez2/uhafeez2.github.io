        Team: Atlanta Hawks<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Kent Bazemore is a player for the Atlanta Hawks, and recently agreed to a five-year extension on his endorsement contract with Under Armour.<br> 
        While not a star player, Bazemore has become an integral member of the Under Armour brand, particularly behind the scenes.<br>
        With with the Golden State Warriors in 2012-13 and 2013-14, Bazemore helped convince Stephen Curry to leave Nike and sign with Under Armour.<br>
        Curry then soared to NBA MVP and championship-winning heights while endorsing the brand, which aided the company's rise as a basketball power.<br>
        <q>He's like the biggest spokesperson for the brand,</q> Curry told ESPN's Sherwood Strauss last year. <q>Always wears new stuff, wears my stuff.</q><br>
        Signing Bazemore keeps the biggest proponent of the brand around the NBA in-house, to the surprise of few. Under Armour has not come out with a Bazemore<br>
        brand of clothing, nor are they likely to, but providing him with merchandise and paying him to be a spokesperson for the company has already paid dividends<br>
        beyond their dreams.
