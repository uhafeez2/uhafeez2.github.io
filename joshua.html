       Title: Professional boxer<br>
       <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Anthony Oluwafemi Olaseni Joshua, MBE is a British professional boxer. He is currently a unified world heavyweight champion,<br>
       having held the IBF title since 2016, and the WBA (Super) and IBO titles since 2017. At regional level he held the British and Commonwealth heavyweight <br>
       titles from 2014 to 2016. As an amateur competing in the super-heavyweight division, Joshua represented England at the 2011 World Championships, winning a silver medal;<br>
       he also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, winning gold. In 2014, a year after turning professional, The Ring magazine named him their Prospect of the Year.<br>
       In 2017, Joshua&apos;s victorious fight against Wladimir Klitschko was named The Ring&apos;s Fight of the Year. As of October 2017, Joshua is ranked as the world&apos;s <br>
       best active heavyweight by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board and BoxRec, and second by The Ring. His knockout-to-win ratio stands at 100%. Joshua is the<br>
       second British boxer, after James DeGale, to win both a gold medal at the Olympics and a world title by a major professional sanctioning body, as well as being<br>
       the first British heavyweight to do so. He is also the second boxer, after Joe Frazier, to win a world heavyweight title whilst still reigning as Olympic champion <br>
       at the top weight. As of November 2017, Joshua has the 12th longest combined title streak in modern heavyweight boxing history at 5 title bouts.<br>
       <p>In 2017, Joshua signed a multi-year extension with American sportswear brand Under Armour. The financial terms of the long-term agreement were not released. <br>
           &quot;I am delighted to be committing my long-term future to Under Armour,&quot; said Joshua. &quot;It is a partnership that has been incredibly successful<br> 
           to date, the brand has helped me increase performance with custom products and new technologies.&quot;    </p>
