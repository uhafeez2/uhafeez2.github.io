        Team: San Francisco Giants<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Gerald Dempsey "Buster" Posey is an American professional baseball catcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB).<br>
        He bats and throws right-handed. Posey has also filled in at first base for the Giants. Posey was born in Leesburg, Georgia. He played four sports in high school;<br>
        when playing baseball, he excelled at hitting and pitching. He attended Florida State University, where he began playing the catcher position. <br>
        He won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008 and was selected by the Giants with the fifth overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft.<br>
        Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. After starting the 2010 season in the minor leagues, he was called back up to the major leagues<br>
        in May. As a rookie, he finished with a .305 batting average, 18 home runs, and 67 runs batted in. He was named the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year.<br> 
        He caught every inning of the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. In 2011, Posey missed most of the year after he was severely injured in a collision with Scott Cousins at home plate.
        <br>Posey returned from his injury in 2012 and posted a .336 batting average to win the 2012 NL batting title. <br>
        He became the second San Francisco Giant to win the batting title and was named the NL Most Valuable Player for 2012.<br> 
        He won his second World Series that year as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers in four games. In 2013, Posey signed an eight-year contract extension worth<br>
        $167 million, a record in sum and in length for a player with his level of experience. He won his third World Series the following year as the Giants <br>
        defeated the Kansas City Royals. In 2016, he won his first Gold Glove award after an excellent defensive season.<br>
        <p>In 2016, UA and Buster Posey agreed to a contract extension. &quot;Buster is everything a team could ask for in a model baseball player, <br>
            and Under Armour is proud to be his long-term partner, &quot; said Ryan Kuehl, VP of global category sports marketing at Under Armour, in a statement.<br>
            &quot;His accomplishments speak for themselves, and Buster&apos;s humility, hunger and never-ending focus on being a better athlete and teammate every day <br>
            are the values Under Armour was built on; we&apos;re excited to see what he does next.&quot;<br>
            As part of the renewed partnership, the San Fransisco Giants catcher will continue to sport the brand&apos;s baseball gear on the field and in training<br>
            as well as support Under Armour&apos;s Connected Fitness and MLB licensed apparel platforms, the company said.<br>
The extended deal also means Posey will now serve the face of Under Armour&apos;s exclusive baseball collection in collaboration with Dick&apos;s Sporting Goods.</p>
