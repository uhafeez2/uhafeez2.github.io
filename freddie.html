        Team: Atlanta Braves<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Frederick Charles Freeman is an American-Canadian professional baseball first baseman and third baseman for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB).<br>
        He has been with the Braves organization since he was drafted by them out of high school in 2007. He made his MLB debut in 2010. He is a two-time MLB All-Star.<br>
        Freeman represented Canada at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, something he had always wanted to do. He was the starting first basemen on Opening Day against<br>
        the New York Mets, going 3-4, including a triple. In the first game at SunTrust Park, Freeman doubled in a couple runs. He continued to tear up Padres pitching,<br>
        hitting three homers in the series. On April 19 against the Washington Nationals, he set a franchise record for most consecutive plate appearances to get on<br>
        base with a solo homer.
