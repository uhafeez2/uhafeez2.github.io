    <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Steph Curry was born in Ohio in 1988 to former NBA player Dell Curry. Stephen Curry garnered national attention for his impressive play at Davidson College.<br>
        He was drafted in 2009 by the Golden State Warriors, and eventually developed into one of pro basketball's top players with his stellar shooting skills. <br>
        After garnering Most Valuable Player honors and helping the Warriors win the NBA championship in 2015, Curry led the team to a league-record 73 wins the following season.<br>
        In May 2016, Curry became the first person to be named Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in NBA history, and one of only 11 players to win the MVP award two years in a row.<br>
        In 2017, Curry helped lead the Warriors to another NBA championship, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers.<br>
        In 2015, Under Armour announced that it has signed Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry to a contract extension that will run through 2024 <br>
        and includes an equity stake.<br>
        <q>In the first two years of our partnership, we accomplished so much both on and off the court, and I'm looking forward to being part of the brand's story<br>
            for the rest of my playing career and beyond,</q> Curry said in a press release. <q>Together we share a passion for making athletes better and instilling self-belief<br>
        in athletes everywhere. The entire team has done an amazing job to develop innovative product that performs on the court and build platforms that allow me to <br>
        connect with athletes all over the world. The best is yet to come.</q><br>
        Under Armour originally signed Curry in 2013 after Nike passed on matching its competitor's offer. Nike originally pitched a deal worth approximately $2.5 million <br>
        before Under Armour offered a contract worth close to $4 million per year.<br>
