       the 2010 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the 2012 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. In August 2014, Mahan won the first of the year's four FedEx Cup playoff<br>
       events, The Barclays. He won by two strokes from Stuart Appleby, Jason Day and Cameron Tringale during a final round that saw six different players share the<br>

       on the PGA Tour. Mahan was selected by Tom Watson as one of his three captain's picks for the 2014 Ryder Cup team, finishing with a record of 1–2–1 in the four<br>
       matches he participated in. This included a halved match against Justin Rose in the singles competition.<br>
       <p>Mahan has been with Under Armour since 2003, and in 2010, Mahan extended his deal with Under Armour</p>
