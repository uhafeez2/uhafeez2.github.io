        Team: Carolina Panthers<br>
        <h3>Biography:</h3><br> Cameron Newton is an American football quarterback for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL).<br>
        He played college football at Auburn and was drafted as the first overall pick by the Panthers in the 2011 NFL Draft. Newton is the only player in the modern<br>
        era to be awarded the Heisman Trophy, win a national championship, and become the first overall pick in an NFL draft within a one-year span.<br>
        He was the 2011 NFL Rookie of the Year, is a three-time Pro Bowler, and was named to the NFL All-Pro First Team in 2015.<br>
        In his rookie year, Newton broke all-time NFL rookie records for passing and rushing yards. He became the first NFL quarterback to throw for 400 yards<br>
        in his first game, shattering Peyton Manning&apos;s first-game record by 120 yards. He also broke Otto Graham&apos;s 61-year-old record for passing yards<br>
        by any quarterback in an NFL debut. Newton went on to become the first rookie quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season. He also ran for 14 touchdowns,<br>
        more in a single season than any quarterback in NFL history, breaking Steve Grogan&apos;s 35-year-old record.<br>
        <p>Newton signed with Under Armour when he left Auburn in 2011 and re-signed in January 2015.</p>
